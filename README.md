## GTM JSON to CSV Converter

This is a simple web app that converts a JSON file exported from a Google Tag Manager (GTM) container to a CSV file. The CSV file can be used to analyze the tags, triggers, and variables in the GTM container in a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

## Getting Started
To use this app: 
1. Simply clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser. 
3. Click the "Choose File" button and select the JSON file exported from your GTM container. 
4. The app will convert the JSON file to a CSV file and prompt you to download the CSV file.

## JSON File Format
This app assumes that the JSON file is exported from your GTM container and was not changed.
